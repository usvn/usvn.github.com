Happy new years,
<br>
<br>
USVN 1.0.6 is now available.
<br>
<br>
Thanks to xxorax you can now configure the default permission for Subversion files on your server.<br>
The new settings are:
<pre>
;; svn files mod on creation	
subversion.chmod = "0770"	
;; svn repo/db/* directories mod (used on fcgi env)
subversion.chmod_db = "2770"
</pre>
<br>
<br>
We also fix a bug in management of groups for an user. We also move the website on github pages, the hosting should be more reliable.
