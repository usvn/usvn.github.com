<p>The USVN project supports GoPHP5 initiative to help transition to PHP 5.2.</p>
<p>Starting now we will accept PHP 5.2.X features into our codebase and our
new feature releases will no longer provide support for older PHP versions.</p>

<p>USVN is already fully compatible with all the PHP 5.X versions and
doesn't support PHP 4 but next versions will require PHP 5.2.X because we
use some functions of this version related to dates.</p>
